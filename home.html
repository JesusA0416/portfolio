      <h1>Welcome(); I'm Jesus Lopez Aguilar</h1>
      <p>
        This is where my academic work livesâ€”essays, research, projects, and whatever else they made me do.
        I'm a college student studying Justice Studies, Political Science, and a little too much all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider this ePortfolio a personal project. I built this site by hand with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        and whatever the word *professional* means.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll find a mix of serious work, personal takes, and assignments that somehow got A's.
        No fake-deep intros. Just the stuff I've done, the way I do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore around, get to know me. Otherwise, why else are you here?
